Visit nodes in topological sort
For each visited node do
    For each available placement (cluster & BigData platforms) of the operator do
        compute cost of shipping its input data to this placement (to exeis apo ta statistika)
        and maintain minimum such cost within this inner for loop
    end for
    place this node at the placement that had the minimum cost in the above inner for loop
end for
